An 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Alzheimer's and others. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The reporter's mother in law was tested for COVID-19 at a nursing facility on 25Dec2020 and she was negative. On 02Jan2021, she received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. On 04Jan2020, she developed a high fever, needed oxygen and was positive for COVID-19. Date of death was 04Jan2021. The cause of her death was listed as pneumonia, respiratory failure and COVID-19. No autopsy performed. No treatment received. No one knew if the vaccination contributed to her death. It was hard to know if her death was due to the administration of the vaccine or it exacerbated the COVID19 symptoms which led to her death. Since this was unknown, it could have been a possibility. The reporter wanted to give us this information because we might want to consider having high risk population, patients with underlying conditions, older population tested for COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, as this is not currently a recommendation or a requirement. All is very new and they are all learning so the reporter wanted to share this information with us. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There are medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was fatal.   Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.; Sender's Comments: The association between the fatal event lack of effect (pneumonia, respiratory failure and COVID-19) with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn't breathe, and his mind was racing.

His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient's address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient's body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner's Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.</td>

On 07Jan2021, the patient experienced: tested positive for COVID (medically significant). The patient died (death, medically significant) on 17Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The reporter stated that in regard to the patient's height and weight: "was probably getting down to about five foot eight. Shrinking." The reporter stated that If she remembered correctly, they were trying to maintain the patient's weight 135 to 136 pounds.    The reporter stated that her father was in a nursing home. The patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 30Dec2020. The patient died on 17Jan2021. The reporter stated that she "wanted Pfizer to know that the little old people in the nursing might not be strong enough for the vaccine." The reporter stated that she was "not calling to complaining."   The reporter stated that there was nothing wrong with her dad. He was elderly with no health issues.  "He was literally on no medications. The only reason he was in the nursing home was because he was afraid to walk." The reporter stated that she received a call about giving the patient the vaccine and she said yes because she wanted him to have the vaccine. One week after the vaccine, the patient tested positive for COVID "like all the other people" (no further details provided). The reporter stated that her dad had no symptoms of COVID. The director of nursing said the patient was doing so well. The patient ate his lunch, he laid down for nap, and at 14:30 he was gone. The patient "went peacefully in his sleep." The reporter then again stated that the patient literally had nothing wrong with him. "They were shocked. They fed him and he took a nap. He was sleeping, but it was eternally." The reporter stated that, "it might not have been the Pfizer vaccine, maybe his heart wore out."  In regard to an autopsy: the reporter stated that they would get it done if needed. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 07Jan2021. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: none.  It was unknown if there were additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect, but the reporter doubted it. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no adverse events following the prior vaccinations. The clinical outcome of the event, died, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, tested positive for COVID, was unknown. The patient died on 17Jan2021 due to an unknown cause of death.  An autopsy was not performed.

      <td>At approximately 930am I arrived at Memory Care.  I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic.</td>

Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, "Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely." 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus + drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, "Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn't improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. " 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: "This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC>4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient's presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient's chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving." 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued.

Physical exam was only notable for 'slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.' The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed " 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.

An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates ("had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before"). On 24Jan2021, the patient's heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient's wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient's wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient's wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient's wife checked, and the patient's blood sugar was 91. The patient's wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; "which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him." Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient's wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient's wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient's wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was "perfect three weeks ago." The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was "fine and everything." The patient's wife stated that other than his diabetes, "which he had for (sentence incomplete)." Regarding lab tests, the patient's wife stated, "No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good" (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient's wife stated, "I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died."  The patient's wife further added, "I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine." The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to "heart stopped."  An autopsy was not performed.

Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient's son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient's son called 911 and the patient's body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient's son is not interested in autopsy. Patient's son reports confidence that his mother's underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death. Other Relevant Hx:  Symptoms: & Death Treatment:</td>

      <td>My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.</td>

See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.</td>

The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction.

The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn't think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn't check her husband's temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband's doctor's office said her husband's temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband's primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn't lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband's primary care doctor wasn't available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor's nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband's doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn't feel any better. Her husband's throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn't tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021.

      <td>Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don't think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I'm sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.</td>

He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels > 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was >90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient's code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.</td>

History is limited due to the patient's current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy.

Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s.

He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.</td>

He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn't make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.</td>

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn't eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient's mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient's father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn't even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient's doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient's temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient's temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient's last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient's follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn't want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient's admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient's temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn't want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient's numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn't do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient's blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient's highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient's blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient's kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn't have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender's Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus</td>

      <td>DEATH-My Mother received her second Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, February 18, 2021 and died three days later on Sunday, February 21, 2021, after being admitted to the intensive care unit at  Hospital.  After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case.</td>

All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure +/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.

      <td>Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for "flu b".  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a "spot" on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat "pneumonia".  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was "atypical and abnormal" what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.</td>

      <td>She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.</td>

He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn't have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.</td>

      <td>My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers' walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers' oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.</td>

Patient noted to smell of urine. CT showed large completed right sided infarct consistent with MCA stroke. Per neurology the lesion was not recoverable and patient would be unlikely to regain any function. Family was notified and poor prognosis was discussed. Patient has been very clear in the past that she would prefer "to go when her time came". She had a DNR And DNI as well. Daughter requested to pursue comfort measures for patient, therefore she was transferred to hospice care. Patient passed away the following day on 3/23/21.

After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt's death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking.

He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient's sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.</td>

The events were reported as serious as involved hospitalization. The patient passed away on an unspecified date in Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. The clinical course of the events included the following information. On 21Sep2020, a spontaneous report was received from a consumer, via a company representative, regarding a 74-year-old male who was being treated with FIRDAPSE 10 MG (amifampridine). On 22Sep2020, additional information was received from a consumer. On 02Oct2020, additional information was received from a consumer and chemotherapy was added as a co-suspect. On 01Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer via a company representative. On 09Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer, and this case was determined to be the master case for cases 2021CAT00039 and 2021CAT00052 (both invalid, duplicate cases) and the information was merged into this case (2020CAT00505). This case was re-assessed as serious/unexpected, and COVID vaccine was added as co-suspect. On 18Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer via a company representative. On 19Feb2021, additional information was received from a patient ambassador via a company representative. Medical history included LEMS (Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and migraines. Concomitant products included: an unknown statin, pantoprazole, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) 81 mg. On 18Sep2020, the patient started treatment with FIRDAPSE 10 mg at 10 mg, 3x/day orally for LEMS. On 19Sep2020 and 20Sep2020, after starting the product, the patient experienced moderate headaches. On 21Sep2020, the patient did not experience a headache. On 22Sep2020, the patient experienced a headache that was "4/10." He had taken acetaminophen; aspirin; caffeine (EXCEDRIN) and ibuprofen as treatment and it "helped." The patient had not spoken to his HCP (health care provider) about the event but was going to call his HCP and ask to increase his dose of FIRDAPSE. The product was working and he was walking better, but he had heard people taking up to 80 mg a day. As of 22Sep2020, product use was ongoing and headaches were improved. On 02Oct2020, it was learned that his medical history included being prone to headaches (also reported as migraines ever since he was a kid) and "chemo" for small cell lung cancer stage 4 which was in his liver and lymph nodes. Concomitant products included furosemide. It was noted that the patient had been on the product for 4 to 5 days when he experienced his moderate headaches. He had the headaches for just a couple days, but he wasn't sure if it was due to the FIRDAPSE or it was the chemo. He took "a couple" of ibuprofen and he was "alright." On an unspecified date, the patient was in contact with his HCP and he was told to "keep an eye on it" (presumed headaches) and see if it got worse. They agreed that it could have been the chemo or a "fluke" thing. He also spoke to his HCP about his FIRDAPSE dose of 10 mg, 3x/day not being enough. He would switch and do a couple doses of 15 mg and it was better, but not enough. His HCP thought he should be taking 20 mg 3x/day, so he was working with the patient's insurance and pharmacy to get it changed. As of 02Oct2020, FIRDAPSE and chemo treatment were ongoing and moderate headaches were resolved (reported as he'd been good for a few days). On 01Feb2021 and 09Feb2021, it was learned that on 02Oct2020, the patient's FIRDAPSE dose increased to 20 mg, 3x/day. On an unspecified date, the patient received the COVID vaccine at an unreported dose, route, and frequency of administration for an unreported indication. After the patient received the COVID vaccine, he experienced a bad reaction (unspecified). Since 27Jan2021 (reported as since Wednesday, relative to 01Feb2021), the patient had been sick. On 31Jan2021, the patient went to the emergency room, and they thought he had a blood clot on his lung. Subsequently, he was admitted to the hospital. Initially, when the patient was in the hospital, they took all his medications away, including his FIRDAPSE, as the pharmacy was managing his medication. The patient wife was able to get the doctors to let the patient keep his FIRDAPSE in his room with him before he missed any doses because he could not walk without his FIRDAPSE. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had radiation of his head and lung for his cancer (previously reported medical history), and "they" (presumed his medical provider) said he could have a raspy voice and headache, which he did experience but then resolved. While in the hospital, the patient's blood pressure was not stable. It went "up and down, up and down." He had fluid in the bottom right lobe of his lung, where the cancer was, and they could not "tap it" due to the blood pressure issues. They were trying to get the fluid out every other way they could. The doctors said he had inflammation in the bottom of his lung. He was given a "good dose" of prednisone, but he was just exhausted. They were trying to control his blood pressure and his pulse. When they got one of them "up," the other went "down." The doctors said that the patient's LEMS had nothing to do with why he was in the hospital. His wife expressed her gratitude for the FIRDAPSE and how it had helped him. As of 09Feb2021, treatment with FIRDAPSE was ongoing. The patient was still in the hospital and not doing well, also reported that he was still the same, he had not improved but he had not worsened. The blood clot on his lung, blood pressure fluctuation and pulse issues, fluid in the bottom right lobe of his lung, inflammation in the bottom of his lung, and exhaustion were not resolved. The status of the bad reaction to the COVID vaccine was not reported. No additional information was provided. On 18Feb2021 and 19Feb2021, it was learned that the patient's medical history included: muscle weakness and lung cancer with brain metastases. On unspecified dates, after starting FIRDAPSE, the patient's muscle weakness began severely progressing, and he experienced fatigue. The weakness was worsening significantly, even after being on the medication (presumed FIRDAPSE). On 14Feb2021 or 15Feb2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. On 18Feb2021, the patient took his last dose of FIRDAPSE. On 18Feb2021 or 19Feb2021 (reported as last night, relative to 19Feb2021; yet also reported as either 18Feb2021 or 19Feb2021), the patient passed away. The cause of death was unknown. A 74-year-old male, with a history of migraines and chemotherapy for metastatic small cell lung cancer, was taking an unknown statin, furosemide, pantoprazole, and Aspirin. He added FIRDAPSE for LEMS on 18Sep2020 and experienced headaches for a couple days, but he wasn't sure if it was due to the FIRDAPSE or chemo. After COVID vaccine, he experienced a bad reaction (unspecified). Since 27Jan2021, he was hospitalized with a blood clot on his lung. He had brain and lung radiation for cancer. While in the hospital, he had fluid and inflammation in the bottom right lobe of his lung, where the cancer was, which count not be drained due to labile blood pressure. His muscle weakness began progressing and he experienced fatigue. In Feb2021, he was discharged on FIRDAPSE. A few days post-discharge, he died.

PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.</td>

      <td>Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed "brain fog" and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies <1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- > 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.</td>

Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.

Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.

This case, from the same reporter is linked to 20210430297.; Sender's Comments: V0: The case concerns a pregnant female subject around age of 40, who developed thrombosis, skeletal injury and exposure during pregnancy an unspecified time after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered intramuscularly for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The subject's past medial history, last menstrual period, estimated date of delivery and concomitant medications were not provided. Per the reporter (pharmacist) the patient was at a high risk for blood clots because she was 4 weeks post-partum. The patient broke her tail bone during the labor, gave a birth, and later died of a blood clot. No additional information was provided. It is not known whether the autopsy was performed. Given alternative explanation and risk factors of pregnancy, labor and skeletal injury (trauma) the event of thrombosis is considered inconsistent with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Events of skeletal injury was result of an accident and therefore not considered related. Company causality for event of thrombosis is considered not related to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Level 4 -Insufficient information available to confirm a possible, probable or a definitive case of venous thrombosis, per the Brighton Collaboration case definition); Reported Cause(s) of Death: BLOOD CLOTS; BROKE TAIL BONE</td>

PT's PCP was contacted, and agreed to certify DC based on known medical history.  PCP also agreed that the death did not sound related to the vaccine based on lack of symptoms as reported by the administering clinic and family.</td>

      <td>Pt. had (what we think) a small seizure on Thursday, March 18th and then again on Saturday, March 20th.  On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link. If you require further information then please don't hesitate to email me Pt. med list at the time of this incident  Modifinil - 100 mg/1per day/AM Sertraline - 100 mg/1per day/AM Vitamin D3 - 50 mg/1per day/AM Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/AM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/AM Furoseminde - 20 mg/1per day/AM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/AM Lisinopril - 10 mg/1per day/AM  Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/PM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/PM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/PM Melatonin - 5 mg/1per day/PM Quetiapine - 50 mg/3per day/PM</td>

A 52-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the age 52-year-old on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hemodialysis for many years, adherent to medical care, multiple DVTs and Pes (On anticoagulants), morbid obesity, Patient was on dialysis for renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant (positive), Afib, allergic to shellfish. Family history included renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant. Concomitant medications included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); metoprolol; amitriptyline; calcitriol; ergocalciferol (VIT D); calcium; calcium acetate (PHOSLO); amiodarone; albuterol. The patient previously allergic to Cipro, clindamycin, doxycyclin, Lyrica, tetracycline. The patient previously was non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient hasn't been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient wasn't smoker/ former smoker. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. A nephrologist who reported patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. More detail is below on each patient. The patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). Unfortunately, the HD unit does not have B/L information (although the B/L # was put on the patient's COVID vaccine cards, a record was not kept in the HD unit). Day she came in for dialysis she was already short of breath she said she'd had body aches for 5 days, got short of breath on 05Apr2021. The day before, started getting cough, nauseous, chills, abdominal discomfort on 04Apr2021. The patient was sent to the ER from dialysis and was admitted for SOB on 05Apr2021 and passed away on 09Apr2021 due to a GI bleed. Patient is over 500lbs so was unable to fit into hospital imaging equiment for CT scans or weight measurements. COVID-19 test was positive on 05Apr2021; the patient experienced COVID pneumonia on 05Apr2021. The patient admitted on 05Apr2021 to regular floor. The patient was moved to an Intensive Care Unit on 06Apr2021. The patient experienced short of breath on 05Apr2021 and required much more O2 than normal. Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.  The outcome of event "GI bleed" was fatal, the event "chest pain" and "body aches" was recovered and other events was unknown. The patient died on 09Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient's multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

The reporter's assessment of the causal relationship between the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of death as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. The event was likely due to progressive complications and life limiting nature of underlying PAH in this elderly patient.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: The information currently available is limited and does not allow a meaningful causality assessment for reported event of death (unknown cause); however, based solely on implied vaccine-event chronological association a causal relationship between this event and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

      <td>my auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it.   My auntie, passed away the next two days after she got her Pfizer Covid vaccine.   My auntie, who is 65 years old, got her Pfizer vaccine the the morning of April 22 2021. She told us he was completely find on the day of the vaccine. But the next morning around 9 am, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  The reported death reason is due to Bowel Ischemia with Perforation and it has nothing to do with Pfizer vaccine that she got. But I believe it is her post Pfizer covid vaccine reaction that result in Bowel Ischemia with Perforation.  My auntie lived with a very healthy life style. She walked every morning, and has a shorter walk in the evening. She has no blood pressure, no blood sugar, everything is fine with her medical check.  My auntie had a kidney transplant 20+ years ago and she is on the track for monthly doctor visit. When she asked her general doctor if she could get the vaccine, her general doctor asked her to consult her kidney doctor. She then went to ask her kidney doctor and her kidney doctor call her general doctor to discuss her health conditions. Both of her doctor decided that she could take the vaccine and one of the doctor registered her for the vaccine on April 15 2021. The she nurse told her to came in for vaccine on Apr 22, and she is now death after the Pfizer vaccine.    I only read about people with recent organ transplant is not recommended to take the Covid vaccine. But there is no information about people that ever had kidney transplant shouldn?t take the vaccine.   My auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it without a clear explanation.   I would like you to contact health department to follow up on this case and find out the real root cause. If the vaccine is not recommended for people that ever got kidney transplant, CDC should publish the information so that there won?t be more victims.   Please take necessary action ASAP.

She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced death right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  Reason of death given is "septic shock secondary to ischemic bowel & intra-abdominal sepsis".   But it is the blood clots issue that is causing it.   I was told that after my auntie got into hospital the very next day after Pfizer vaccine, hospital later found out that my auntie has blood blockage issue that is causing blood couldn't flow to her intestines. The acid in her blood was very high, 6+.  After more than 6 hours without blood to her intestines, her intestines tissues start dying and turned black color. Doctor found out about this at the night of April 23, 2021 nighttime. April 22, 2021 morning is the day my auntie got her Pfizer covid vaccine.

The patient presented to emergency room with gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever and cough on unspecified date. The patient was sent home. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient was COVID-19 positive and was admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was on oxygen via nasal cannula. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient had high fibrin D dimer and patient had a stomach bleeding. The patient was worsening and was admitted to intensive care unit. On unspecified date, the patient developed arm weakness which progressed over days. On unspecified date in 2021, the patient had massive stroke and passed in the morning. The stroke did not show the signs of hemorrhage. The distribution of stroke was multifocal and could suggest thrombus. The patient developed thrombocytopenia in the last 24 hours of life.  The initial computerized tomogram (CT) noted one area of focal stroke. The second CT showed worsening large multi-focal left hemispheric stroke in multiple distributions. This was an acute development over the previous CT. On 26-APR-2021, physician reported the radiology report was not clear whether the Cerebroventricular accident (CVA), the patient had experienced was a thrombotic event as the patient had areas on the CT scan that could be old CVAs and in addition the patient had hypertension. The patient developed thrombocytopenia on day 12 while she was treated with heparin. D-dimer was elevated on admission and throughout the hospitalization and the anti- PF4 antibodies were not able to be performed from the sample available.

Additional information was received from physician on 26-APR-2021 via telephone log from a company employee. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: reporters added (physician and contact),due diligence updated and physicians statement.; Sender's Comments: V1:  The follow up information in this version is regarding addition of reporters (physician and contact) physicians statement and due diligence. This updated information does not alter the causality of previously reported events.  This 79-year-old hypertensive female died from massive stroke after being hospitalized from COVID-19 pneumonia 1 day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. On admission to hospital the patient had positive COVID-19 test. She also had a high fibrin D-dimer throughout the hospitalization and developed a stomach bleeding.  Other symptoms included arm weakness that progressed over a couple of days.  Initial CT scan noted one area of focal stroke; the second CT scan showed worsening large multi-focal left hemispheric stroke in multiple distributions.  Platelet count was initially 157 and dropped to 86 on an unspecified date.  The patient was treated with heparin.  The event of stroke is confounded by the underlying hypertension and COVID-19 disease; and the event of thrombocytopenia is confounded in COVID-19 infection.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal plausibility and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn't get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I'd have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.</td>

April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to "get it out of her system." Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were "confused" and everything happening to my mom was "a mystery." Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she's worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn't be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and "confused,"  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn't indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system "go crazy."   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother's blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother's eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.</td>

      <td>I had a patient come in at 10:05am for a Moderna Covid vaccine. Just before 11am we received a call from the patient's roommate that the patient arrived home and collapsed, it was also mentioned her blood pressure was high. We explained that they needed to call 911 but the patient did not want to go to the hospital. We explained that this patient must go to the hospital and get evaluated. They did end up calling 911.  Approximately 45 minutes later I received another call from the patient's roommate that EMS did not believe this was a reaction from the vaccine. The roommate mentioned that she was in fact mistaken about the blood pressure and it was actually low (92/54 mmHg). She also mentioned that the patient was vomiting.   Around 1:45pm I received a call from the roommate to tell me that the patient had died.</td>

Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

Received her second Moderna dose from our Mobile team on 4/14/21    Since then I spoke with Dr. (Mobile); clients PCP, several times regarding this event.  His nurse got an email from client on 4-12-21 that client had vaccination planned on 414 and may need to reschedule medical appointment planned 4-16 if she felt bad. The client was encourage to get vaccine and to keep appointment for Friday April 16th.  The client  emailed the office at approx 0300 Friday morning  April 16 to cancel appointment because she felt to poorly from vaccination shot to come in  (fevers; body aches). Dr next heard from police officer on Monday April 19th that she was found dead in her home. He requested the Medical Examiner (ME) evaluate but this request was denied. The client lived alone. Dr contacted family members but they did not have much interaction with the client and had no significant information to contribute. Dr said he speculates that the patients underlying anorexia nervosa likely put the client in a critical nutritional deficiencies / electrolyte imbalance condition and the side effects of vaccination were too much. He felt compelled to complete the death certificate as he did because the ME declined the case.   From vaccine mobile team notes:  team was there2-3:30pm. All the answers to the health screening questions for the patient were "no" except for "have you ever had a severe allergic reaction to something?" To that question the answer was "yes.

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs. Operative Procedures Performed Treatments: See above; Procedures: Na Consults: pulmonary/intensive care and general surgery. Pertinent Test Results: CT abdomen pelvis with contrast [3279871876] (Abnormal) Resulted: 04/25/21 1811. Order Status: Completed Updated: 04/25/21 1812. Narrative: PROCEDURE INFORMATION: Exam: CT Abdomen And Pelvis With Contrast, Exam date and time: 4/25/2021 17:36, Age: 71 years old, Clinical indication: Abdominal pain; Additional info: Sepsis, bowel perf. HX of Covid19 +, malignant colon with lung metastasis. Bowel perf. TECHNIQUE: Imaging protocol: Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Radiation optimization: All CT scans at this facility use at least one of these dose optimization techniques: automated exposure control; mA and/or kV adjustment per patient size (includes targeted exams where dose is matched to clinical indication); or iterative reconstruction. Contrast material: 350 OMNI; Contrast volume: 80 ml; Contrast route: INTRAVENOUS (IV); COMPARISON: CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W CONTRAST 4/23/2021 16:46, FINDINGS: Tubes, catheters and devices: Catheter terminates in the right atrium in satisfactory position. Lungs: Moderate airspace opacities throughout the lung bases are similar to prior and consistent with Multilobar pneumonia consistent with the history. Liver: No hepatic masses. Gallbladder and bile ducts: Cholelithiasis. Pancreas: No ductal dilation. No masses. Spleen: No splenomegaly or focal lesions. Adrenal glands: No mass. Kidneys and ureters: 10 mm benign left renal cyst, no follow-up necessary. No renal masses or Hydronephrosis bilaterally. Stomach and bowel: Redemonstration of perforated proximal sigmoid diverticulitis. Small pneumoperitoneum is stable. Predominantly gas containing, 25 x 28 mm collection adjacent to the inflamed sigmoid colon similar to prior; a fistulous tract extends toward the midline containing gas and fluid, with suspected fistula to adjacent loops of small bowel. Moderate to severe descending and sigmoid diverticular burden. Minor right diverticular burden. No small bowel obstruction. A somewhat clumped appearance of small bowel in the right lower quadrant near the colon enteric fistula. Appendix: No evidence of appendicitis. Intraperitoneal space: Mesenteric edema around the small bowel, slightly increased, however no new mesenteric collection. There is no extravasation of enteric contrast into the collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon. Vasculature: Mild aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Lymph nodes: No significantly enlarged lymph nodes. Urinary bladder: Unremarkable as visualized. Reproductive: Unremarkable as visualized. Bones/joints: Degenerative changes in the spine. Multilevel disc space narrowing. Multilevel central canal and neuroforaminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. No acute fracture or subluxation. Soft tissues: Small fat-containing right inguinal hernia. Small fat-containing left inguinal hernia. Large ventral abdominal hernia containing gas, which has replaced the previous contents of fat and bowel loops. Volume increased compared to prior. IMPRESSION: 1. Redemonstration of perforated proximal sigmoid diverticulitis. Small pneumoperitoneum is stable. 2. Similar perisigmoid  collection; colon enteric fistula, probably at least subacute in duration. The perisigmoid collection is prominently gaseous and there is no frank abscess. 3. Suspected mild enteritis the small bowel loops or loops associated with the fistula. No obstruction. 4. Additional findings as described are similar to recent prior imaging.

Active Problems: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon. Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present COVID-19. Perforated viscus. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.</td>

Patient advised me that he needed to go to the hospital because he was not feeling well and his oxygen level was low.   We called 911 and was taken to the hospital.  After at the hospital I advised a male nurse  that I was concerned about his leg being swollen cause he had been given the Jansen Covid vaccine and I was concerned about blood clots.   Everyday I would tell someone in the hospital (never saw a doctor I could talk to) about his swollen leg but did not really get anyone interested. Before he was moved to a Veteran?s State Home, I overheard someone saying they were going to give him his anticoagulant.  I?m filing this  report in case the swollen leg was a result of blood clots due to the vaccine.</td>

Patient was diagnosed with a "concussion" and sent back home, and was instructed to follow-up with his primary care provider on 4/30/21. On 4/30/21, patient was "sleepy all day." On his way out of the house around 3:30, he suddenly put his hand on his wife and proceeded to collapse. The wife also fell, and by the time she gathered herself and went to check on her husband, he had passed away. An ambulance came to the house; CPR was performed for 40 minutes but "they could not get him back." He was not transported to a medical center. An autopsy was not done, but the coroner informed patient's wife that he likely died from a "clot, maybe a PE." Wife wonders how this could be, since he was on Plavix for 5 years. Wife does not feel that the COVID vaccine is to blame, but thought she should report the issue just in case. This writer is assisting wife of patient to fill out electronic report.</td>

      <td>Daughter reporting after her mother's death .  She got her vaccine and called her daughter in the afternoon around 2:00 and told her that she got it.  At 6:00 she received a VM where she said that she was having joint pain and wanted to know if she could call her doctor to get her joint pain medicine.  Later that evening her daughter told her that was why she was put on the Hydroxychloroquine and they wanted her to see the rheumatologist.  She complained of pain a lot, but she specifically asked for joint pain medicine.  On the 22nd on another VM her daughter noticed that she sounded raspy hoarse sounding and congested and had a cough.  Then subsequent messages after that the hoarseness was there that didn't go away.  Her daughter took her to the dentist on 4/15/21 and she remembered that the caregiver told her that she did not want to go to the dentist as she did not feel good.  She did not like to get out of the apartment.  Then on 4/19/21 she was admitted to the hospital and that she had pneumonia.  They were going to discharge her home and she was going to pick her up on 4/22/21, and then they called her back and told her that she sounded junky and they were going to keep her another day.  She made arrangements to pick her up on Friday and then her oxygens dropped and would discharge her on Monday.    She normally gets oxygen 1 liter of oxygen only at night, and when she was admitted her oxygen levels were low and they put her on 6 liters when she was admitted.  Then she was weaned off oxygen completely, and her daughter informed them that she slept with oxygen and that's when they were talking about going home.  On Friday she dropped her oxygen level into the 60's  On Saturday 4/24/21 she was on 9 liters of oxygen and the doctor came in and said that she was on 14.  By Saturday night she was on the Critical care Unit, but her on Vancomycin and was on Vapotherm on high-flow oxygen and she had maxed out at 40 liters at 100% oxygen.   They talked to the daughter about putting her on ventilation and thought it was toxicity to Vancomycin and other things and couldn't figure it out and said that it was some sort of inflammation of her lungs.  They put her on high levels of steroids and was then taken off of high-flow oxygen and then was still on 20% liters.  They recommended hospice and palliative care.  They decided to bring her home on Hospice with 15 liters of oxygen.  It was up and down levels.  She was given steroids when she came home on Hospice and was given steroids.  She then started to decline and hospice nurse came and she was admitted to Hershey and they repeated her chest x-ray and COVID testing, and that her lungs were so scarred there was nothing that they could do for her.  They tested her for COVID multiple times, the CAT Scans came back that it was worsening and consistent with COVID but tested negative twice while was there.  She was then sent to Hospital and tested again and was negative, and she passed on 5/10/2021.    HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS: She was admitted to  on 4/19/21 discharged home on hospice on 5/6/21.    She was admitted to Medical Center on 5/6/21 and she died on 5/10/21 at 5:48 PM.</td>

Medical history included Leukaemia in 2018, High blood pressure with 40 years, Diabetes in 2016, Atrial fibrillation in 2018.The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6199) in left arm on 07Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. She had just had her blood drawn in Feb2021 and her blood was ok. So on 07Mar2021 she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. At 96 years old, after the Covid 19 vaccine, her mother's body was full blown with leukemia. Radiation wasn't an option to stop the overproducing of her white blood cells. The Covid 19 vaccine just accelerated it. Maybe there are others out there in this condition and should be double checking to see if they should get the Covid 19 vaccine.  On the 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021 her mother started having a hollow cough. She wasn't congested but she continued to cough. She noticed her mother was breathing heavy and fighting to breathe on Friday, on16Apr2021. It wasn't getting any better and she thought her mother would have more trouble so she took her to the emergency room. She reported she took her mother to the hospital on 16Apr2021.She was admitted on 16Apr2021 and discharged on 18Apr2021. They gave her some oxygen and did some tests. They asked her mother if she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and she did not, they suggested that it was her atrial fibrillation. She has had atrial fibrillation in the past, her doctor did leave her on her atrial fibrillation medication. She can't recall the name of the atrial fibrillation medication. She was discharged home on 18Apr2021 and she was breathing ok on her own. But by that next Tuesday, 20Apr2021, she noticed her mother was declining. She wasn't acting like herself. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, she was more tired and her difficulty breathing started back up. On Thursday, 22Apr2021, she called the ambulance to take her mother to the hospital. She could tell that her mother wasn't herself, she could hardly talk on 22Apr2021 , she couldn't stand up, she lost control of her bowels. She wasn't responding to her. The caller knew something was going on. They put oxygen on her mother and they transferred her to a cancer specialist hospital. That's when the doctor realized it was a leukoblast. Clarified with caller, leukoblast. Then her mother died. She died on 28Apr2021.The caller knows the hospital was doing tests to see what was causing her mother's pain, but she doesn't have that information. She heard the screams from her mother and there was no consoling her mother. The hospital gave her mother morphine and it didn't work. She has no product information for the morphine, it was given in the hospital. She was screaming for murder, screaming for help and was given the morphine. Within a month of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine her leukemia was back and her mother was screaming in agony and pain because her sides were blowing up in pain. Whatever the Covid 19 vaccine did in her body, her body thought it was fighting off something. She had no red blood cells that could provide oxygen to her organs. She was weak. Overproducing of her white blood cells on an unspecified date. The lab data included White blood cell count abnormal and Red blood cell count decreased. Outcome of her mother's body was full blown with leukemia/she wasn't responding was fatal, of remaining events was unknown. Treatment received for all events.

A 65-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The cancer doctor told her that she needed a Covid vaccine since she has cancer and a lowered immune system. Medical history included Metastatic rectal cancer from Jul2019 to 17May2021, Osteoporosis from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had it for maybe 10 years or something), Fibromyalgia from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years). She had rectal cancer, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, and a couple other things that the caller can't think of off hand. Her mother was diagnosed with the rectal cancer in Jul2019. The caller has no idea when she was diagnosed with the osteoporosis. She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years, and the caller is sure it was the same for the osteoporosis, maybe 10 years or something. They were being managed. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient did have metastatic rectal cancer, but it was managed. She was not on hospice or terminal, and they hadn't exhausted all of the treatment plans yet. It was being controlled. She was under the surveillance of a cancer doctor who was completely shocked by her sudden death. It seemed like there was no reason. She was fine and drove herself to her appointments all the time. She had just driven herself to her last appointment. She passed away yesterday morning. She was slowly declining since she got the vaccine. The coroner was playing guessing games and assumed it was pancreatic cancer. Well, she didn't have pancreatic cancer, and the doctor already said the cancer didn't kill her. The doctor said if he had to guess it could have been some kind of pneumonia or a reaction to the vaccine. All of it made her heart stop. The coroner couldn't get the city to approve an autopsy to see the real cause of death because there was no foul play. The caller took it upon herself to discover if maybe Pfizer could help, and she needs to alleviate the vaccine as an option if it contributed. She is so tired and hasn't slept. It is devastating. This woman was everything in her life, and the caller is probably going to go next with how she feels. She feels responsible. Her other guess is if she gave her mother Covid and she slowly declined with pneumonia. The caller couldn't get her sister to take her mother to the ER. Her sister was there Sunday night. On Monday morning her sister called to say her mother was gone. On 05May2021 the patient had the first dose of the Covid vaccine. The caller could have gone there or called an ambulance when her mother wasn't answering the phone. She knew something was wrong. She called her sister who said their mother wasn't feeling good. Her mother was woozy, dizzy, and sleeping all the time. On day 3, Sunday, the caller couldn't get her mother on the phone. She thought she had some level of peace because her sister was there and could keep her updated. Her mother often gets sickly, but she always answers the phone even if she is deathly sick. The caller thought enough is enough and she needed to be put on the phone on speaker with her mother. The caller's sister said her mother was sleeping. The doctor said to probably bring her mother to the ER. The caller told her sister who just didn't take her mother to the ER. The caller could have called an ambulance. She feels incompetent. They are assuming the cause of death was a heart attack. If her mother had gone to the ER on Sunday night they may have found out. Her mother became woozy last weekend because the caller was there on Thursday and her mother didn't look good. She had her chemo bag because she brings it home. It was her first new chemo treatment, and the caller had never seen her mother respond like this. It was strange. Any other time when she was getting chemo she felt great because there is so much stuff in there like steroids to prevent a reaction. It was surprising because she was only sick on chemo once and she had been on this one before. She was just off. Then she continued to decline from there. It started before the chemo. She got on chemo that Thursday before Mother's Day, she was on her first chemo treatment at that time. She was sick a couple of days before that. She had the chemo on 06May2021. She started feeling sickly the day she got the injection on 05May2021. When the caller was there she was thinking it was from the chemo. The caller calls her mother every day and she was sounding worse and worse. On Thursday 13May2021 her mother took herself to her chemo follow up appointment and was telling the doctor that she was woozy, dizzy, and not eating. The doctor gave her fluids, and he didn't give her chemo because she was not scheduled for it that day. It was just a follow up appointment. He sent her home. The caller talked to her mother on Thursday evening and she didn't sound good and told her she was woozy and dizzy. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday she didn't answer the phone. The caller's mother is totally against vaccines, and she had been begged to get the pneumonia and flu vaccine and denied them. She had never responded well to them in her life. Even as a cancer patient they would say she needed it and she wouldn't. She did get the Covid vaccine even though she didn't want to. The caller thought her mother was trying to convince herself it was because of the vaccine because she is so against them, but now she doesn't know. The doctor said he didn't think it would have been Covid because she didn't have a fever. Her mother told her that she had been running a fever off and on, which is not unusual for her mother. The doctor didn't think it would have been Covid. Her mother started sleeping all the time mid week last week. She started not eating at the end of last week. The caller has no idea when her mother had a fever. She hadn't gotten to talk to her mother all weekend. At some point last week her mother had said in a conversation that she had a fever off and on. Then on Thursday when she went to the chemo doctor she had no fever it shows it was 97 something. Her oxygen was fine. Her blood pressure was a bit low, 105 over something, which is low for her. She didn't have a fever last Thursday. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks no other vaccinations. Blood work on 13May2021 with unknown result. The patient passed away on 17May2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The caller expresses concern that her mother may have had Covid. No autopsy done. Cause of death was Heart attack.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart attack</td>

      <td>On April 15th, the otherwise healthy 30 year old daughter of my cousin passed away in a hospital from a massive stroke and seizures related to encephalitis of unknown cause.    She recovered easily from Covid19 back in November of 2020, along with several of her close friends and family members with no lingering effects.  On March 30th, she was given a single dose of the Moderna vaccine along with her teaching colleagues at a local high school. She initially complained of mild nausea and vomiting but quickly developed a severe headache prompting her to visit the local ER where she received treatment for a migraine. She returned to the ER at least one more time after no relief from the headache. By April 3rd,Saturday, she no longer recognized her sister nor knew what a mask was for.  Her family rushed her again to the same ER and she was subsequently transferred the following day to a Hospital.   Due to dangerously high intracranial pressure, she suffered a stroke with paralysis of her left side and a seizure.  Multiple lesions were noted on her brain via MRI. A shunt was inserted to relieve the pressure, she was intubated and placed into a deep coma from which she would never awaken.  Despite these medical interventions and pharmacological interventions, the pressure did not subside.  A craniotomy was performed the following Saturday as a last ditch effort to relieve the unrelenting pressure in her brain.  The craniotomy was able to reduce the pressure but it was too late.  There was no longer any brain activity and my cousin's daughter was removed from life support after they were able to say their goodbyes.     The medical examiner will be examining her brain to attempt to find a cause but that report may take 6 months.</td>

They should not have died they just died. he doesnt know if it was a side effect, he knows if it was a reaction but all of the six residents that got vaccinated died within their first vaccination shot.

Both of them died in their sleep (Further not clarified hence not captured in tab).

So, they had the on-duty nurse there to answer any of the questions that we had. We asked then all the questions we had. We felt ok with it, everybody got vaccinated that day.

At Hospital, she was treated with convalescent plasma, course of remdesivir, and dexamethasone. She was requiring HFNC during day and BiPap overnight. She began to improve with decreasing O2 requirements on 4/15. On 4/17, she was found to have L-sided deficits and increasing hypoxia, which required emergent intubation. Dexamethasone was increased to 6 mg BID and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration penumonia, consolidated to ertapenem on 4/20. She had been on Eliquis prior to this, but this was discontinued after she developed the stroke sx on 4/17, switched to Lovenox. Initial head CT negative, but repeat head CT on 4/19 showed large R sided MCA territory infarct. She was placed on ASA. 4/21 head CT showed edema and mild midline shift. Neurology was consulted, who recommended hyperventilation, 3% saline, and elevating HOB > 30 degrees. She was then transferred to St. Mary's ICU on 4/21. At  Hospital, patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia (cefepime 2g Q8H on 4/22-4/25, meropenem 2g once on 4/22, tobramycin 400mg daily on 4/22-4/23) and COVID.  However, she had significant difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. Given her prolonged course and her right MCA CVA with significant deficits it was predicted that she would need long term ventilatory support therefore PEG and tracheostomy were placed on 4/29. She remained relatively stable until 5/2 AM when she suddenly developed massive subcutaneous emphysema and hypoxia. It was suspected that her tracheostomy had become dislodged. Patient was re-intubated orally with difficulty however there was no color change with EtCO2 and patient was in cardiac arrest. CPR was briefly performed however code status was clarified and patient was DNR. Trauma surgeon and intensivist were in agreement that any other interventions would be futile.

An 81-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 81-year-old in Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bladder cancer. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  Caller states ''My sister and I both received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. My sister developed Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration two weeks after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. They did find a half cm tumor in her fallopian tube. Her doctors have reported the side effect but at that time she was not fully diagnosed. They thought at that time it was meningitis .'' Caller wants to know if Meningitis or Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration has been associated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Response: Spoke from the attached document. These two disorders have not been listed as side effects associated with the vaccine. However we may not have the list of all the possible side effects associated with the vaccine. Caller was reporting side effects for her sister related to the Covid 19 vaccine. Her sister had received the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine and 2 weeks later developed a disorder called Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. They had found a tumor in the fallopian tube that was a tiny half centimeter tumor. Said that the doctors had reported the side effects but at the time it was not yet diagnosed as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. At the time, they thought she had meningitis. The event happened about 2 weeks after the vaccine, so about 11Feb2021, was about 2 weeks before or 2 and a half weeks before 11Feb2021 that she got the vaccine. She was in the hospital 10 and a half weeks (about for 74 days). She contacted Pfizer, she believes in Mar2021. Since Feb2021 she had been in 3 different hospitals. They did send her some paperwork but she has not completed it yet. At that point in Mar2021 her diagnosis was meningitis. As it later turns out, it turned to a new diagnosis of the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Her sister lives in PRIVACY, she does not even know where she went for the vaccine. She hasn't filed the written report yet. She was not diagnosed with the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration until the very end, 10 days before she died. She died on 24Apr2021. Cause of death: They had removed her ovaries and fallopian tubes had the suspicion that this might have been the diagnosis without ever seeing the tumor. She had multiple CT scans (2021) and never saw the tumor until they removed the fallopian tubes. They found a 1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes which is what the cause of death was. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. The caller is terrified to get the vaccine, since she had bladder cancer. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. They did not do an autopsy, probably because that was up to her brother in law and can understand why an autopsy was not done. They also say when her sister was having all of these bizarre symptoms, it was an auto immune reaction. She was perfectly fine and had come home from a bird watch. She had severe headache, eyes would move back and forth involuntarily in 2021. That never went away. She had severe vertigo in 2021, and it all happened in one day, it didn't go away. They did an immunoglobulin infusion treatment, she had very good treatment. They put her on steroids. The immunoglobulin treatment was for five days and nothing touched those symptoms. They had moved her from one hospital to a rehab facility in PRIVACY. The rehab doctor reported all of these symptoms to Pfizer. At that time, they were still calling it meningitis. He said that the elephant in the room was the vaccine. Felt the vaccine is not totally what caused it but accelerated what ever was going on with her, these bizarre disorders. Maybe this would have happened without the vaccine. They will never know. She wishes that someone can tell her whether or not she should get the vaccine. She asked her doctor who said he was not going to tell her to not get the vaccine. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. The patient was hospitalized for events for 74 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The patient died on 24Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  The outcome of event half cm tumor in her fallopian tube/1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes was fatal.

Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR> l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr's office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient's wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient's blood pressure & HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient's room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest & pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient's cardiologist & personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient's death. Upon review of the patient's course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired</td>

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine.

The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender's Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

All he knows from the emergency technician is that it looked like he went back to his car and his dog was in the car and he dropped dead. According to you guy's thing, it says muscle cramps, muscle pains and chest pains are all side effects of this and he does believe that the vaccine contributed to the chest pain which contributed to the heart attack that exploded his heart.

Caller stated the coroner's has already stated that he died by the coronavirus shot and mucked up his arteries, his heart. It is pretty sad.

My family strongly believes the COVID vaccine killed him and not the cancer. He  also experienced neurological issues in his right leg and right arm and had trouble swallowing after getting the vaccine. He was able to walk up and down stairs prior to getting vaccinating but not afterwards We don't believe this vaccine should be taken by anyone who has a compromised and weakened immune system and who is battling cancer. We believe it also accelerated the cancer.  I know of someone else who received both doses of the vaccine who had cancer years ago and now fears she may have cancer again.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient had some acute shortness of breath and chest pain. Reportedly she was calling from the nursing home stated that she was trying multiple times and she needed to speak to someone to report adverse reactions, she had been reporting to the VAERS system since they started giving vaccines in January, stated: "she had summitted probably 30 reports at that point of all different various things in any of the patients even if they were in hospice if they had a vaccine and proceeded to pass away, she done all the reporting. She had a very abnormal large volume of patients that got vaccinated on 16th of April, with the first doses of Pfizer (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) one specific lot number and she had 7 adverse events in one group of patients out of 30. And it was way too complicated to get that information quickly, so she spoke to somebody as there was a chance that those could be a significant event and needed to tell somebody what was going on". Caller stated: "because all the reports involving one lot it was more suspicious than even all the other reports that she had ever done. It was just one whole group and now she had 3 deaths. She had 3 deaths and have 2 strokes in this group". Caller stated that she would file reports online she just wanted someone to call her back about the side effects and the lot involved. Stated "she got the whole group, who were due to get their second dose on Friday, two days from now, so obviously she not giving it to any of these people there was a 7 of them out of 33. She had 20 staff that have received it the same day she did not have any side effects in any of the staff but definitely little weary at the moment." Offered to forward provide information to safety. Caller provided lot EL9269, Expiry date 01May2021 (stated that it was weird because it was very close to the expiration date). Caller stated: "All those people were dosed on March 26th. Caller stated that she was going to give just basics (in terms of information to start the process) and that she would file a form online. Caller stated: "That day 31 patients received a vaccine and she had 7 patients worth investigating (caller stated that she had that portion written if there was a way to forward. Explained that there was an option to contact through our website but for adverse reports specifically she would refer them to Pfizer safety explained that she also had a fax, but caller declined she already had that information. Verified that she was reporting adverse events (7 patients, gender: 5 females and 2 males). Caller stated "three patients were send out and subsequently passed away in the hospital, one patient with bradycardia, hypotension and she passed away in the ER, critical labs, she did not even make it one day, we send her out and she passed away in the ER. She had one male patient who had acute stroke she did not have all the details because he was still hospitalized in ICU. She have one (patient) who we sent to the ER hypoxic, hypotensive, short of breath, she ended up passing away in the hospital, her diagnosis there was hypoxia and acute CHF. She had another male patient who had an acute CVA we send him to the hospital he had acute CVA, he had a right artery occlusion, he passed away. She had another female patient who was sent out with shortness of breath and increased confusion, she wound up in the ER with hypoxia and sepsis and she passed away. She was sure that she did not have hospital records, only know what she was told. And then had two others one that was send to the ER with shortness of breath and elevated D-dimer, she actually returned to us her scans were negative, so she was one of those we are not really 100 percent sure, but she did get send out to the ER. And we have another one (female) chest pain, shortness of breath, she was not sent out her D-dimer and her studies that we have done here were within normal limits but definitely had some acute shortness of breath and chest pain. Done troponin and bunch of cardiac labs there, she did not go out. So those were the seven that she had at the moment that were concerning. Outcome of the events was unknown.

      <td>My dad suffered what I believe to be a blood clot in his lung on April 6th, directly related to the second pfizer covid vaccination. Though chronically ill, he was not sick at the time, which was 4 days after the vaccine. He walked up the stairs, collapsed at the top, walked again to the chair, collapsed and then made his way into the chair where he told me "I can't breathe." and then slumped over. My mom and I lifted his limp body up and noticed he was not breathing.  We moved him to the floor and started life support measures. About 5 minutes later the paramedics arrived.  They were eventually able to get his heart and breathing going again about 14 minutes later.  He was moved to critical care.  After it became apparent he suffered irreparable brain damage, I stopped the life support measures (ventilator) and he passed away shortly after on Friday the 9th. They were continuously removing blood from his lungs while he was there. There was no indication he would die prior to this incident. Though we attempted to tell the critical care doctors about his recent vaccination, they were not receptive to the suggestion that this may have caused the incident that proceeded his passing. My mom did try the heimlich and there were indications that he had breathed in vomit, but he had stopped breathing before this and therefore his cause of death WAS NOT aspiration. He also had fallen the day after the vaccination (Saturday) and the notes indicated his broken ribs were from the CPR measures but this is in error as well as he had broken his ribs in the fall. It is my opinion the broken ribs caused a bruise in the lungs, the vaccination caused excessive clotting, and when he was coughing shortly before the incident it loosened the clots that then caused a pulmonary embolism.</td>

CT abdominal and pelvis with contrast showed infiltrating mass in the left hepatic lobe concerning for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with reactive adenopathy. Additionally, left mid ovarian vein thrombus found. No thrombus in the renal veins or IVC. 4/28: Venous duplex demonstrated bilateral leg acute DVT. Eliquis was started. 5/7: Pt underwent laparoscopic biopsy/paracentesis. Eliquis was held 2 days prior to laparoscope...5/11: Pt presented to hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, fatigue and leg pain. CTPA showed bilateral PE. Pt received heparin drip and was switched back to Eliquis on discharge. Echocardiogram on 5/12 noted mobile round mass in RV junction, right atrial mass; presumed to be a thrombus. Pt additionally with elevated troponin, determined to likely demand ischemia related to PE; EKG without any acute changes. Discharged on 5/24. 5/27: Patient started on chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.  6/4: Presented to the ED again due to worsening dyspnea and home pulse ox readings in the 70s. CT chest showed moderate burden of bilateral obstructive pulmonary emboli with no overt RV strain. EKOS and clot retrieval was contraindicated d/t thrombocytopenia. Was noted to have demand ischemia, and transitioned from eliquis to heparin gtt. Vascular was consulted for eval of her ischemic right foot, and deemed that it needed amputation, but would be a high risk surgery.  6/8: Patient was transferred to this reporting institution for second opinion requested by the family. Upon arrival, patient was found to be obtunded and hypotensive requiring heated high flow nasal cannula and vasopressor with norepinephrine. Code status was deemed DNRCCA/Do not intubate per family. Bedside ultrasound was concerning for an LV mass. Cardiology and Vascular surgery were consulted and recommended that the foot be amputated as well, but requested further workup with ECHO and CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis to further evaluate the LV mass. During admission workup, she was incidentally found to be COVID PCR positive. She was started on DEXA-ARDS prednisone dosing, remdesivir, and placed in enhanced droplet isolation.  Her hospital course was complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pulmonary emboli, COVID-19 infection, and underlying malignancy requiring heated high flow nasal cannula. Empiric cefepime was started to treat any underlying superimposed pneumonia. Due to extensive clot burden with limb ischemia, as well as + COVID, she was systemically anticoagulated with a heparin drip despite her thrombocytopenia. She was intermittently given platelet transfusions in order to keep platelet count >30. TTE was obtained on 6/11 which showed large masses in right ventricle and right atrium, vegetations on mitral valve, aortic valve, and tricuspid valve, and probable mass in IVC. She also developed AKI with oliguria related to shock and critical illness. Medical oncology was consulted and she unfortunately was not a candidate for further chemotherapy at the time due to critical illness, as well as ischemic limb. (If further treatment was pursued, she would need a left leg amputation, then would require 4-6 weeks of recovery before additional chemotherapy could be given.) She slowly became more encephalopathic and had increased oxygen requirements, requiring continuous heated high flow nasal cannula. Goals of care were discussed with her family. Given her advanced cancer, it was decided to transition to comfort-focused care. Her code status was changed to DNRCC. Symptoms were controlled with IV pain and anxiety medication.

      <td>I am filing this on behalf of my sister, who feels it needs to be reported but she is too grief-stricken to do this herself.   The morning after the second shot, my sister texted that her husband was up at least 10 times during the night, and five times the next night. He was agitated and hallucinating (swatting at bugs that weren't there.) For the next four weeks he had progressively more difficult breathing, and on 4/28 a liter of fluid was drained from his chest. He continued to have difficulty breathing and was taken by ambulance to Hospital on May 2 where they again drained his chest and diagnosed him with pneumonia. A nurse told him they were seeing a number of cases of fluid around the lungs (his fluid was around the lungs, not in them) after COVID vaccines. He was sent home May 4 and commented that it was strange his cardiologist hadn't visited.   Almost immediately he was experiencing liver and gall bladder pain, even though tests for those showed the two organs were healthy. On May 8 my sister said patient woke up hyperventilating, which also became more frequent. On the 9th his daughter told me the labs were not trending well, and on May 10 he saw his cardiologist. He diagnosed him with congestive heart failure and got him an appointment at the Heart Hospital on May 17 - he explained congestive heart failure is scary but can be managed through programs at the heart hospital. He began sleeping outside because it made it easier to breathe.   On May 15 he was advised to go to the ER/Hospital for tests the heart hospital would need and, once there, they discovered his kidneys weren't functioning and he was admitted immediately. He spent 17 days at Hospital- if the kidneys improved, the heart got worse. If the heart improved, the kidneys failed. He was released on June 2.   On June 7  my brother took him to get blood work done - Patient was too weak to get in and out of the car by himself. The blood work came back bad, and on June 8 he was admitted to the Heart Hospital. On June 10 he was transferred to the Regional Community Hospital to be closer to his cardiologist. From there he continued to decline, and the doctors wanted to do surgery for a LVAD but couldn't. To help him get stronger, he had an impeller put in by catheter on June 19 and died that night.   His own cardiologist said congestive heart failure is manageable. The symptoms started the night of the second vaccine and his illness wasn't gradual - he went off a cliff. With all the heart problems appearing in males, we don't think this was coincidence.</td>

The patient's medical history included Stents from 2005 (a stent placed in 2005; a heart attack in 2017 and additional 5 stents were placed in 2017; a stent placed in his neck in Nov2019); Heart attack from 2017; Reaction to contrast dye from 2005 (has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents; had a stent placed in 2005 and had a reaction to the dye then; a mild heart attack in 2017 and did stents; once again had a reaction to the contrast dye); Sensitivity to bug bites (When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots; the last few years the patient's reaction to bug bites got much worse); High blood pressure. Additional information for other conditions: The patient was very highly allergic or has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents. The patient had some heart stents and he had bad reactions to the contrast used. The patient was allergic to different things. The patient couldn't take codeine. When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots. Reaction to contrast dye: the patient's physicians then wanted to do imaging with contrast dye on the patient's neck. Physician put the patient on a cocktail for 24-48 hours before the stent was placed and the patient still had a reaction. The patient was given a cocktail of Benadryl and 2 other medications that she cannot remember. The patient's reaction to the dye was not as bad as the first 2 but he still had one. The patient had the stent placed in his neck in Nov2019. The patient still had a reaction to the contrast dye, a mild reaction, even with the cocktail. The reaction was enough the patient was told to continue taking the medication afterward. The patient always carried a nitro bottle in his pocked but he never took any of them. They asked how the nitro tablets were and they were powder. They were blessed as far as the patient's heart. Concomitant medications included cetirizine taken for allergy problems; amlodipine taken for high blood pressure for years; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) (for the arteries, just to keep the blood thin, the patient began taking aspirin after experiencing side effects from Effient). The patient previously received codeine and experienced sensitivity (Couldn't take codeine, goes way back, 40-50 years). The patient previously received prasugrel hydrochloride (EFFIENT) from 2017 and experienced shortness of breath (The patient was put on Effient after his stent placement in 2017. Doctor took the patient off of Effient and instructed him to just take aspirin because the patient was showing side effects of shortness of breath and different things. Doctor informed the patient that he would rather the patient just take Aspirin than have the side effects from Effient). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) at left arm on 12Jan2021 (80-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced "so excited" (the patient was so excited after the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously received tetanus vaccine toxoid (TETANUS) shot for immunisation (20 years ago at least) and experienced "Couldn't move arm, arm swelled and turned red and was messed up for a while". Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Patient's wife reported that she and her husband (the patient) took the COVID-19 vaccines on 12Jan2021 and 02Feb2021. After his second dose, the patient kept telling her that he didn't feel good and that he was tired (from 03Feb2021). The patient just did not feel good. The patient was cold and so cold to the touch (from 03Feb2021). On 03Feb2021, he was dragging. The patient just wanted to stay down and didn't want to get up. She asked the patient if this was going to keep him in the room all day. The patient replied that he just couldn't wake up. The patient was tired and cold and couldn't get warm. The patient lost 30 pounds (in Feb2021) after he got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient walked around holding his pants up. The patient would eat very little and he didn't like to eat. When he was weighed at the doctor on Friday 02Apr2021, he weighed 136 pounds fully clothed. The patient normally weighed 150-160 pounds. The patient had lost a lot of weight. The patient's color was off, stating that one of her friends said the patient looked grey. The patient experienced pressure in lower stomach (in Feb2021). The patient told her that in his lower stomach, he described it as pressure, and the patient thought he was just kind of sore from coughing from the sinus infection. The patient couldn't stand clothes to touch him and would cut holes in his underwear elastic so that it wouldn't press into him. The patient went to the doctor twice from the time he took the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to his death (on 04Apr2021). The patient went to the clinic. The clinic thought the patient had a sinus infection (from 27Mar2021) and gave him a shot that would make him feel good. The patient got a shot on 27Mar2021. She wasn't sure what the shot was and she didn't get a print out. They treated the sinus infection with amoxicillin-clavulanate (875mg-125mg, manufacturer is Teun). The amoxicillin hadn't worked well and the patient went back to the clinic a second time on Friday, 02Apr2021. When the patient went to the doctor on 02Apr2021, they were unable to get a register on the finger pulse-ox monitor. The patient's physician did an X-ray (on 02Apr2021) and the X-ray was perfectly fine (normal). Nothing showed up on the X-ray at all. The patient passed away easter Sunday morning (04Apr2021). The cause of death listed on the patient's death certificate is due to consequence or problem of pulmonary embolism (from 04Apr2021), respiratory impairment. The patient did not receive an autopsy. The family didn't feel the need and the staff didn't even ask if the family wanted an autopsy. "When you live to be 80 years old, you're blessed." HCP: The patient's heart doctor did not see the patient on 04Apr2021 before he died. The last time the patient saw the doctor was Dec2020. The wife reported that she is not complaining, the patient made the decision to take the shot, she is just concerned that the patient had something that could help someone else. The wife stated she was not trying to complain at all, she took the COVID-19 vaccine right beside him and had no consequences. She didn't even have a sore arm. The family is just concerned that there is an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine or something that could trigger that in them. Yesterday, 23Jun2021, they were showing a lady on TV that was so sick (unable to provide details). "The patient" (unknown to which patient this is referring) got the shot and ended up in the hospital with side effects. The wife reported that's why she wanted to let Pfizer know about her husband. She was just reporting the patient's symptoms and was not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings in the world. She is not blaming the COVID-19 vaccine for the patient's death, and stated that it could have been his heart or more anything. She just felt like she needed to let pfizer know some of the side effects the patient was having that didn't start until after the second COVID-19 shot. The wife unable to provide the NDC number, lot number, or expiry date of the patient's COVID-19 vaccines. She does not have the information but her son does have that if Pfizer wanted to call and talk to him. The adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room; the adverse events requiref a visit to physician office (The patient went to the clinic 27Mar2021 and went back 02Apr2021 for Sinus infection). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event sinus infection and included a shot and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The outcome of the event pulmonary embolism/ respiratory impairment was fatal; outcome of other events was unknown. The patient died on 04Apr2021. No autopsy was done.

He never tested positive for Covid19, however his first symptoms were the typical fever, muscle aches, rash. He declined daily from a host of mysterious symptoms including full body rash, blood clots, muscle spasms, atrial fibrillation, ulcers lining his esophagus and colon, and exorbitant WBC (157K) with extremely high eosinophils (90%). He was treated with a host of drugs including antibiotics, steroids, blood thinners, ivermectin and finally chemotherpay (Campath). His ICU team  included hematology, pulmonology, ... oncology and infectious disease. After an incredible amount of diagnostic testing ( daily routine blood work, EKGs, chest x-rays, CT scans, MRI, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, colonoscopy, skin biopsy, genetic testing) no definitive diagnosis could be made, however, he was given the possible diagnosis of chronic eosinophilia leukemia in late May. The big question among the medical staff was, "Did the shot trigger something?" He was eventually treated with the chemotherapy drug Campath, which reduced the WBC and EOs some, but his organs, especially, lungs had been very compromised by the high WBC and eosinophils. Several days after being placed on a ventilator and given a feeding tube at the end of May, a CT scan and MRI confirmed patient had suffered multiple strokes. He passed away a half hour after being taken off the ventilator the morning of June 3, 2021.

The day after the vaccine was administered, her lower arm was swollen, red and her elbow felt hot to the touch.  It was too painful to fully extend her arm.  There was a white streak across the reddish purple elbow area where it appeared as though there was an infection growing.  She went  to her normal doctors office, she saw his nurse practitioner who took an x-ray and gave her two intravenous injections of antibiotic (unknown type).  One in each buttock and prescribed an oral antibiotic: Cephalexin 500 mg., and Ibuprofen 800 mg. From that day forward she was unable to move the arm at all and the medication did not bring the swelling or the infection down.  She was very tired and her arm did not lessen in pain as the days passed.    On June 29, 2021 she was in her bedroom and her older daughter was in her room and believed her mother was resting.  At approximately 7:20 p.m., pts. husband returned from work and came into the master bedroom turning on the television.  As he did so he made joke expecting pt. to laugh or comment, when she made no response he looked over at her and saw that she was laying on the love seat at an awkward angle.  He moved to her side and saw her eyes were open but unseeing and saw that her dental prosthetic was partially pushed out of place.  He removed and called EMS immediately, not detecting any obvious signs of life.  Her daughter came into the room and immediately started CPR.  Paramedics arrived in under 2 minutes and moved pt. to the living room where they could intubate a breathing pathway and carried on with attempts to revive her heart muscle for approximately 25 minutes before Paramedic called time of death at 8:02 p.m.   Paramedics departed and the Police arrived staying  until the Mortuary attendants came to the home at about midnight to accept pt. body for transport to its facility.      The Family is seeking an autopsy and the coroner is claiming one is not necessary.  The family believes it is absolutely necessary to ascertain whether or not the second dose caused her death as it seems is likely and whether she should have been advised of her heighten risk level. Regardless of COVID 19 Emergency measures, an autopsy is necessary and the family is determined to ensure that it is conducted.   Pt. has had a history of the following: Adult onset Asthma, allergic reactions in skin rashes that were significant. Hypothrodism (Graves Disease) which proved to be difficult to find the right meds to bring it under control; prone to incidents of Atrial fibrillation which have escalated as she has aged; she has been treated for emergency visits for Tachycardia; she frequently has developed respiratory issues as a result of the asthma which often landed her  in  the emergency and days in the hospital on oxygen.  She often experienced shortness of breath and chest pain and last year underwent emergency appendicitis.  Her last episode of atrial fibrillation which landed in the hospital was 12/29/16.  She has been on anticoagulants for many years.    Since COVID 19 she may not have been able to afford her Eliquis prescription however which she did not disclose to any of her family members that she was struggling in this wasy.   She is likely not to have been taking her Hypothyrodism (Graves) medication either since these medications have not been recovered since her death.</td>

A 69-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 69-years) as dose 1, single and second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), via an unspecified route on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 69-years) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included Hodgkin's disease from 1978 (they took his spleen out, so he was a little immunocompromised and they took out his spleen and appendix after diagnosis) and unknown if ongoing. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date, the patient experienced had 3 antibody tests- one that was a 15minutes finger prick and two others that were all 2-3 weeks apart. Patient stated all 3 tests were negative for antibodies and his doctors don't know why. His doctors said maybe it did not detect antibodies to the vaccine. In 1978, he had Hodgkin's disease and they took his spleen out, so he was a little immunocompromised. However, the infectious disease doctor said since he got both doses he should still be protected. Reporter was concerned that he didn't had great immune system when three negative tests came back, he just want to make sure that everybody thinks he was not okay because he was going out over usual instructions because of them. His primary care physician (PCP) said he talked to another doctor and said if he had the vaccine it should be covered but the test came back negative. Reporter stated that the "last test he had was on 24May2021, it was COVID-19 antibody test, SARS test, COB test 2, AbIG Quantitative. This one was done on maybe 10th (unspecified date in 2021) it was rapid test for SARS, COB-2, IGg antibody. That was done on 07Apr201 and stated if Pfizer want, he can give that also, SARS, COVID, COB-2, IGgAb, AbIGm, they all came back negative". Patient's wife stated her husband passed away and at the time of the vaccination she and her daughter got adverse reactions she would like to fill the form for both her and her daughter.

      <td>Pt received Moderna covid 19 vaccines on Feb 6th 2021 and March 6th 2021.  She was diagnosed with new aggressive possible lymphoma or lung cancer for which she  ultimately died from on 7/2/21 . Daughters reported symptoms started suddenly 5 1/2 weeks ago around 5/20/21. PCP notes confirm this. She saw her PCP on 5/25 for the cough and a cxr done that day was normal. She was prescribed tesselon perles and azithromycin.  She presented back on 6/8 with persistent cough with new hemoptysis, decreased appetite and weight loss and ct scan done 6/15 showed a large heterogenous mass of the mediastinum 6.6 x 7.6 x 13cm encasing the r main pulmonary artery the r brachicephalic, r subclavian and common carotids. There was mass effect on the trachea and r main stem bronchus. The 6mm nodule seen in the posterior left upper lobe was stable and unchanged from previous ct chest from 9/20. This rapidly progressed in a very short time resulting in her admission to the hospital  for respiratory failure on 6/28 and she was so unstable we were unable to transfer her for a biopsy and start of treatment as recommended by oncology. She passed away on 7/2/21. The family decided they wanted to pursue a limited autopsy to have the mass biopsied to determine what the cancer was which was so rapidly progressive. They describe her as prior to the start of the cough and hemoptysis  on 5/20 that she was living alone, used no assistive devices and other than her dementia was generally healthy and was very interactive and involved with her family</td>
